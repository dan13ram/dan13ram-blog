Hello guys, welcome to my blog! This is my first post and might seem dumb, cause I am! 
And I'm happy to be dumb because I know I can be smarter. If I decided I am smart, then i would never want to explore anything more, or expand my abilities. But knowing and accepting that I'm limited makes me more conscious and selective as well as explorative in my approach to understanding life.

# Hello world!

I'm writing my first blog post right now. I never thought that I would be using markdown to write my blog, but when I actually think about it there can be no better option. This is fantastic. I can write in vim and it gets directly uploaded onto my website in a nice format! 

I can add images like this 

![test](/img/chemex.jpg)

I can add todo notes like so

- Make website
- Write Intro
- Join trojan Dao


I can also make numbered nodes like so

1. This is first
2. This is in between
3. This should be last


Hope you learnt something about markdown. Until next time!

Ciao
