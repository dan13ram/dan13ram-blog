Hello guys, welcome to my blog! 

# Hello world!

I'm writing my first blog post right now. I never thought that I would be using markdown to write my blog, but when I actually think about it there can be no better option. This is fantastic. I can write in vim and it gets directly uploaded onto my website in a nice format!

I can add images like this

![Bob Dylan Smoking](/img/charcoal-portraits/bob-dylan-smoking.jpeg)

I can add todo notes like so

-   Make website
-   Write Intro
-   Add Content

I can also make numbered nodes like so

1. This is first
2. This is in between
3. This should be last

Hope you learnt something about markdown. Until next time!

Ciao
